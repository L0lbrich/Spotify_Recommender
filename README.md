# Spotify_Recommender
 
First off, this code wont function without the spotify database file and I couldnt upload it since its too large. Second, there is a offline model that is also not provided which was also too large to upload, however the code for creating and downloading the model still exists and can be created again.

This webapp is designed to take a single song as input and return the 5 nearest neighbors from the spotify dataset. It also provides a link to open each provided song in spotify.

Here is a video of it functioning ->> https://streamable.com/3iksxw

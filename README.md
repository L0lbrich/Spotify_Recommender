# Spotify_Recommender

This webapp is designed to take a single song as input and return the 5 nearest neighbors from the spotify dataset. It also provides a link to open each provided song in spotify.

First off, this code won't function without the spotify database file and I couldn't upload it since it's too large. Second, there is a offline model that is also not provided which was also too large to upload, however the code for creating and downloading the model still exists and can be created again.



Here is a video of it functioning ->> https://streamable.com/3iksxw
